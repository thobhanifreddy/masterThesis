This thesis offers an intricate exploration of maritime shipping's carbon emissions, unraveling the complexity through a systematic analysis. 
By categorizing vessels into distinct segments, the research provided a nuanced examination of emissions behavior and identified multifaceted factors affecting carbon emissions. 
Practical and cost-effective measures for emissions reduction were explored, contributing valuable insights to environmental sustainability in the maritime industry. 
The study also sets the stage for future research, emphasizing the inclusion of port emissions and analysis across more vessel segments. 
The findings signify a substantial advancement in understanding maritime shipping's carbon footprint, offering practical solutions, and laying a foundation for ongoing exploration and responsible industry practices.
