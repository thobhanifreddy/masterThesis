\section{Background and Motivation}

In the 21st century, climate change is the biggest challenge faced by humanity.
It poses a substantial danger to the survival of the inhabitants of our planet.
Human activities such as deforestation, extraction and burning of fossil fuels have led to a rise in global temperatures.
The consequences of such activities are an increase in sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity.
There is an urgent and undeniable need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a sustainable and low-carbon future.

Maritime shipping is essential to the global economy.
It accounts for transporting 90\% of the world's goods by volume.
It is also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions,
with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimating that maritime shipping accounts for 3\% of global carbon dioxide emissions.
While 3\% may seem small, it is important to note that this is a rapidly growing sector.
Without action, maritime shipping contribution to carbon emissions can increase by up to 10-13\% in the next few decades.
Due to this fact, there is a growing global effort to reduce emissions from this sector. \autocite{king_anthony_2022}.

The European Green Deal is a significant initiative by the European Union to make Europe the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050 .
It aims to transform various sectors, including shipping, to reduce environmental impacts.
Through meticulous analysis of total carbon emissions within the maritime sector using advanced data techniques,
this research can significantly contributes to the goals of the European Green Deal. It can aid in formulating policies, monitoring progress, and promoting sustainable practices,
aligning with the Green Deal's emphasis on innovation, global cooperation, and eco-conscious industrial transformation \autocite{siddi2020european}.
This study's alignment with the European Green Deal underscores its relevance and importance within the broader context of sustainability-focused endeavors.

In accordance with Sustainable Development Goal 13, in 2018, the initial strategy was adopted by IMO's Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC),
during its 72nd session at IMO Headquarters in London, United Kingdom. According to this strategy,
the IMO will work towards reducing the total annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 50\% by 2050 compared to 2008 \autocite{imo-2018}.
In the 76th session of MEPC in 2021, serval mandatory measures were adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping,
which will help in achieving the goal of reducing emissions by 50\% by 2050 \autocite{imo-2021}.
One of the important measures is the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII).

Maritime shipping is a complex and highly volatile system, generating very large data sets.
Big data analytics can be used to understand the complex system and make informed decisions.
It can facilitate operations such as monitoring of emissions and predictive analysis of vessel performance.
This can help in reducing emissions and improving the efficiency of the maritime sector \autocite{ZAMAN2017537}.
